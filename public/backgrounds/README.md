# Background Images

Place your romantic background images in this directory to use them in the Love Counter app.

Recommended naming convention:
- romantic-1.jpg
- romantic-2.jpg
- romantic-3.jpg

For best results, use high-quality landscape images with dimensions around 1920x1080 pixels.

## How to add your own images:

1. Save your image files in this directory
2. Use the URL format: `/backgrounds/your-image-name.jpg` in the app configuration
3. Or use direct image URLs from the web like `https://example.com/your-image.jpg`

Note: If no image is provided, the app will use a beautiful gradient background by default.
